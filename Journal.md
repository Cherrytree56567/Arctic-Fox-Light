# September 16th: Found an LED and started the PCB.

Finding a good LED for my project was pretty hard. I needed an LED that I could integrate in KiCad and change the color of. Aliexpress was my first option where I was able to find this [RGB WS2812B 5V 5050 LED](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009855473477.html) for pretty cheap. Then I needed a microcontroller that would support Bluetooth and WiFi for the Smart Home Integration. I was able to find the ESP32-C6-MINI-1 on [Espressif's ESP Selector](https://products.espressif.com/#/product-selector) Website. The pcb itself is pretty messy, but Ill get that sorted tomorrow.
