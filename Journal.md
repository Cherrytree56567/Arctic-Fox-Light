# September 16th: Found an LED and started the PCB!

Finding a good LED for my project was pretty hard. I needed an LED that I could integrate in KiCad and change the color of. Aliexpress was my first option where I was able to find this [RGB WS2812B 5V 5050 LED](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009855473477.html) for pretty cheap. Then I needed a microcontroller that would support Bluetooth and WiFi for the Smart Home Integration. I was able to find the ESP32-C6-MINI-1 on [Espressif's ESP Selector](https://products.espressif.com/#/product-selector) Website. The pcb itself is pretty messy, but Ill get that sorted tomorrow.

# September 17th: Wiring Is Hard!

Wiring up the MCU and the LEDs and stuff is really hard. Looking at diagrams and datasheets is even worser. Most of the datasheets didn't really show me what to wire up and where, so I had to look online, but there wasn't any info online. So I had to do my best, by reading the datasheet and connecting things. I wasn't really sure if what I had connected was 100% correct, but hopefully im lucky and I don't mess up somewhere. At least wiring up the PCB was easier.

# September 17th: 3D Modelling!

Making the Arctic Fox was pretty hard because I have never tried to make minecraft characters before. Ive made enclosures so that part was a breeze. I was able to finish the fox head. Oh, by the way, this project is a part of my school's art project where we 3D Print a Minecraft Character and Paint it. I decided to turn it into a lamp, so I needed to use thin layers of white PLA. Ive used 1mm, but 0.5mm could give a greater result. Ill report back once its printed.

# September 18th: Arctic Fox Modelling!

3D Modelling the Arctic Fox was hard, but I was able to do it. Unfortunatly, I forgot to add the USB C Port Cutout before submitting it, so I can't change it again. I used M2 Screws and M2x3mm Threads since I already have those. I took inspiration from this [Sleeping Arctic Fox](https://www.printables.com/model/403207-sleeping-arctic-fox-minecraft) 3D Model from Printables, because it looked fairly accurate.
